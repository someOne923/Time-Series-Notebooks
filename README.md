## Time Series Notebooks

Focuses on time series forecasting using deep learning techniques to predict future values based on historical data. The objective is to develop a robust model that captures temporal dependencies and trends within sequential datasets. Leveraging architectures like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Units), the model is trained on time-stamped data to perform tasks such as stock price prediction, weather forecasting, or demand estimation. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The final solution aims to deliver accurate, interpretable forecasts that support data-driven decision-making in dynamic
